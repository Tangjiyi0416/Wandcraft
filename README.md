# Wandcraft
Have you ever found a almost-perfect wand that has all the stats you want but ruined by "Shuffle"?
Or a wonderful always-cast wand that is infact useless because of its more than 2 sec recharge?

Hopefully, it will no longer be the case with this mod.

This mod adds many upgrade spells for wands includiing "Reduce Recharge Time", "Anti-shuffle" and more!

Hope you enjoy this mod. And if you have any suggestions be sure to leave me a comment!
